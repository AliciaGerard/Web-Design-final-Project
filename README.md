# Web-Design-final-Project
End of semester project in web design. Summer 2018
The teacher had very few rules as this was a basic web deisgn class

  - Had to have an email form
    - This was a basic form with little CSS might update later if not working on other projects
    - does not actually go to an email
  - Had to have images that change in two ways when hovered over
    - Mine go from black and white to color and get larger
  - Had to have a widget of some kind
    - I chose a clock due to its ease of set up 
  - Had to have a logo
    - My photoshop skills have improved but I was short on time at the time
